A Retro Tetris Game as Flutter Package

## Behind the scenes
The game is written by using a CustomPainter widget so it is more performant than using a lot of widgets for each Tetromino.

The game is capped at 30 frames per seconds, thats more than enough
for a tetris game. That's more energy efficient than running it on high fps just for the sake of having high fps.

## Features

Modern rules:

- It uses a bag of Tetrominos and randomly chooses one out of it until the bag is empty, then the bag gets filled again with one of each of the 7 Tetrominos. This ensures that the same Tetromino can not appear multiple times in sequence



Also:
- Level up by increasing score
- Game Speed inceases on each level up
- Score multiplier based on how many rows have been swept at once
- Shows the next Tetromino at the top right corner
- Hold a Tetromino (held Tetromino is shown in the top left corner)
- Ghost Tetromino that shows where the current Tetromino would land
- Keyboard and Touch controlls are supported

## Controls
Keyboard:
- Arrow key ðŸ ”ðŸ –: move the Tetromino left/right one space
- Arrow key ðŸ —: move the Tetromino down one space
- Arrow key ðŸ •: rotate the Tetromino clockwise
- Shift + Arrow key ðŸ — : immediately land the Tetromino at the bottom
- Space: Hold the current Tetromino

Touch:
- Swipe left/right: move the Tetromino left/right one space
- Swipe down: move the Tetromino down one space
- Tap: rotate the Tetromino clockwise
- Long Tap : immediately land the Tetromino at the bottom
- Tab the Hold Area at the top left corner: Hold the current Tetromino


## Use this package as a library

### Depend on it

With Flutter:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutris: ^1.0.0
    path: "path/to/flutris-folder"
```

### Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:
```dart
import 'package:flutris/flutris.dart';
```


## Usage
```dart
// Imports
import 'package:flutris/flutris.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// MyApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: "Flutter Tetris",
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MainPage(title: "Flutter Tetris"),
    );
  }
}

// Main Page
class MainPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MainPage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MainPage> createState() => _MainPageState();
}

// Main Page State
class _MainPageState extends State<MainPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
        centerTitle: true,
      ),
      body: LayoutBuilder(
        builder: (context, constraints) => SizedBox(
          width: constraints.maxWidth,
          height: constraints.maxHeight,
          // All there is needed is to use the Flutris widget
          // The size determines the size of the game area
          // Here we made it responsive bei using a LayoutBuilder
          // and its constraints
          child: Center(child: Flutris(size: constraints.maxHeight)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
